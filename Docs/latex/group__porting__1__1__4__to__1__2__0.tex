This module describes porting from F\+L\+AC 1.\+1.\+4 to F\+L\+AC 1.\+2.\+0.  


This module describes porting from F\+L\+AC 1.\+1.\+4 to F\+L\+AC 1.\+2.\+0. 

There were only very minor changes to the interfaces from 1.\+1.\+4 to 1.\+2.\+0. In lib\+F\+L\+AC, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__flac__format_ga996f8732a2502ad79a68bb4a9f945235}{F\+L\+A\+C\+\_\+\+\_\+format\+\_\+sample\+\_\+rate\+\_\+is\+\_\+subset()}}} was added. In lib\+F\+L\+A\+C++, {\ttfamily F\+L\+A\+C\+::\+Decoder\+::\+Stream\+::get\+\_\+decode\+\_\+position()} was added.

Finally, value of the constant {\ttfamily F\+L\+A\+C\+\_\+\+\_\+\+F\+R\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+H\+E\+A\+D\+E\+R\+\_\+\+R\+E\+S\+E\+R\+V\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+EN} has changed to reflect the conversion of one of the reserved bits into active use. It used to be {\ttfamily 2} and now is {\ttfamily 1}. However the F\+L\+AC frame header length has not changed, so to skip the proper number of bits, use {\ttfamily F\+L\+A\+C\+\_\+\+\_\+\+F\+R\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+H\+E\+A\+D\+E\+R\+\_\+\+R\+E\+S\+E\+R\+V\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+EN} + {\ttfamily F\+L\+A\+C\+\_\+\+\_\+\+F\+R\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+H\+E\+A\+D\+E\+R\+\_\+\+B\+L\+O\+C\+K\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+S\+T\+R\+A\+T\+E\+G\+Y\+\_\+\+L\+EN}
